# 1. Context

*   What are the forces at play?
*   What is the problem that needs to be solved or the pattern that needs to be formalized?

*   Explain the reasoning behind this specific choice.
*   Detail the technical implementation required.

## Positive Consequences
*   *e.g., Simplifies cross-lab interoperability.*
*   *e.g., Improves system security.*

## Negative Consequences
*   *e.g., Adds complexity to initial setup.*
*   *e.g., Requires a new external dependency.*

## Neutral Consequences
*   *e.g., Changes the underlying ledger technology.*

| **Originating Lab:** | *e.g., open-science-dlt (Pillar I) or EHDC (Pillar IV)* |
| **Lab Feature/PR:** | *Link to the relevant PR, commit, or branch where this pattern was validated and proven.* |
| **Promotion Rationale:** | *Why is this pattern being generalized and promoted to a universal UCF standard?* |
