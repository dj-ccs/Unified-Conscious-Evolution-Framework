## Differentiation: Vision vs. Implementation

**This directory (vision/):** External-facing, polished, executive-level summaries

**UCF main docs (docs/):** Internal architectural documents, detailed specifications, governance

**Implementation repos (e.g., EHDC):** Working code, technical documentation, pilot management

**Key principle:** External audiences need clarity and inspiration. This directory provides both.

_These documents represent the UCF at its most accessible - the constitutional vision expressed for those who will help build it._
